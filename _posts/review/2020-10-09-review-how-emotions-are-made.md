# Review: How Emotions are Made
#### The Secret Life of the Brain
##### Lisa Feldman Barrett (2017)

{% include image.html url="how-emotions-are-made.jpg" alt="Book cover" %}

* No essenses
    * Everything is a concept
    * Right about this
    * Map/territory - mean as measurement, mean as generative
        * Generative concepts?
    * Does distinguish affect from emotion
        * Emotion as requiring words, 
* Cashes this out as:
    * No universal emotions
        * Fair enough
    * No single truth about whether someone is feeling an emotion
        * Social constructivist philosophy generally endorsed
    * Proactive rather than reactive creatures
        * Balance between individual responsibility and inherited concepts
            * Kinda Dennettian
            * You could have these views on essentialist+reactive grounds
            * These views are not entailed by constructed emotions
* Doesn't really address what we should do differently
    * Does discuss Power of social reality
        * Doesn't that make social reality worth studying?

## Notes

[^1]: Somewhat coincidentally, this is almost exactly what I earn as a PhD student

[^2]: Testing policies, and cautiously expanding them in scale and to new contexts, is a robust and sensible way to ensure we do things that actually work, and which minimise unintended, undesirable outcomes. Showing that giving free money to everyone in a small town produces good outcomes doesn't guarantee that those same outcomes would be realised if you gave free money to everyone in the world, but it does show that giving free money to people is a potentially great idea, and it should be explored further.

[^3]: Quite what constitutes 'enough' is rather hard to pin down. Humans tend to define enough (once key drives are met) in relation to those around them, so it's difficult to pick out exactly what level of consumption is acceptable as a baseline.  

[^4]: People who see work as valuable in and of itself argue that a life of pure leisure would lack meaning. Quite aside from the fact that much work fails to provide a sense of meaning (see _Bullshit Jobs_, also reviewed on this blog), it's highly likely that once we stop looking to work to provide meaning we will seek it in other places. Both the aristocracies of the past and the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_-style visions of the future provide models for filling lives with creativity, learning, discussing and debating, and caring for others in the community (including spending time raising children).

[^5]: This is a simplistic example, but it at least illustrates the point that demand is created by people and that therefore more people create more demand.

[^6]: At least you would think so, but witness the debates in the USA over the merits of public healthcare.

[^7]: I should point out that I've not read _The Case Against Education_, but I believe an accurate summary of its central argument is that education has become a pointless means of competitive evaluation rather than a means of ensuring adequacy for a role as a citizen or employee.

[^8]: Bregman talks about the way some work destroys value, using a similar conception of value to Varoufakis in _Talking to My Daughter_ (also reviewed on this blog) which bottoms out in improvements to lived human experience.

[^9]: Raeworth's _Doughnut Economics_ (also reviewed on this blog) provides sketches for some of the ways in which some of the ideas in Bregman's utopias could be operationalised and implemented.

[^10]: Which is perhaps a pity, because I'm probably the sort of person he's rather hoping to convince to be more politically active.

[^11]: There are some notable efforts in this vein, such as Michael Sandel's Public Philosophy events.
