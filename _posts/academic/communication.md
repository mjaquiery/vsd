Communication is important, perhaps fundamental, to being a human self. People spend a great deal of time communicating, through a diverse array of mediums, and much of the time appear to have little actual information to transmit. I suggest that two key goals of communication are information exchange and social relationship management, and that these goals interrelate in complex ways.

## What is communication for?

There are two main goals of communication: exchanging information and managing social relationships.[^1] My subfield, decision-making and advice-taking, tends to focus on the former, while more social-psychology-heavy fields focus more on the latter. 

### Exchanging information

All communication has some content: some information that the sender wishes the receiver to process. That information is most obvious when it is intended to solve some problem as with coordinating activity or making a group decision.

#### Advice

A large part of the ostensible uses of communication can be thought of as 'advice'. Advice here means simply that information is transmitted from one agent to another, and includes direct information ("I have to cancel our meeting on Thursday") and attentional direction (pointing to something interesting, "you should read this paper on decision-making"). In a network of cooperating agents, advice can help agents develop a shared, accurate corpus of information about the world without everyone having to experience everything firsthand. 

##### Internal states

A subset of advice which bears special mention is the communication of otherwise-unknowable information about the internal state of other agents. This information can be very important for social animals.

#### Group decision-making

Group decision-making is a more or less formal process of aggregating information from various members in order to produce a decision. Most often, it refers to processes where there is a single final decision shared by the whole group, as when a swarm of bees use a [quorum process](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2006/04/honeybee-decision-making-ability-rivals-any-department-committee) to locate a new hive site, or when a committee elects a new chairperson. At other times, final decisions are made by each individual, hopefully better informed as a result of the process, for example participants at a public debate.

#### Coordinating activity

Communication is also used to coordinate activity: a feature so prominent that some now-roundly-criticized arguments suggested such coordination, particularly group hunting, provided the evolutionary pressure for language. While it seems unlikely language evolved solely for coordinating activity, coordinating activity is nevertheless a powerful use of language. Communication facilitating coordination can be linguistic (e.g. American Football players calling plays) or non-linguistic (e.g. Baseball catchers signing to the pitcher).
 
#### Redundancy of information

A puzzle about language from an information-transfer perspective is its redundancy: most of the content of linguistic utterance is readily predictable from what has come before (it's far easier to predict the last word of a sentence than the first!). This property, elucidated by [Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), trades robustness for efficiency: an exchange well worth making in a world where talk is cheap and understanding is important.

### Managing social relationships

In evolutionary terms, the inefficiency of communication in transmitting information, and the infrequency with which it is used for solving survival-oriented problems seems like a puzzle. It is worth remembering, however, that social organisms' worlds are overwhelmingly susceptible to the influence of other agents. This means that avoiding or solving problems which arise from other agents is a key part of problem solving for a social organism.[^2]

#### Prediction of other agents

Actions of other agents can have dramatic effects on us. This is no less true in cooperative contexts than in competitive or predator-prey contexts. Predictive processing frameworks would suggest, then, that a key goal in cooperative communication is to make ourselves more readily predictable by others. As we learn about one another, we become both more able to anticipate reactions and behaviours, and more able to interpret subsequent communication.

#### Interpersonal

Much communication involves the formation, maintenance, and adjustment of social bonds. Language in humans has been suggested as a replacement for grooming which leaves hands free for other tasks, for example.[^3] Our sense of individual identity is closely embedded with group membership and comparision, and often solidified through explicit communication.

#### Group identity/shared values

A ubiquitous use of language in human cultures is gossip: discussion about people (usually people who aren't present), their interactions, and their feelings. Gossip serves to put exemplars of behaviour through the court of public opinion, and allow the attendant social norms to be discussed and applied.

## Methods of communication

Different methods of communication are suited to different goals, which can be viewed as split along informational or social lines. Gestural methods can be good for managing social communication (consider the rise of emoji to address the lack of gesture in an increasingly written-word-focused world), while the written word can be excellent for transmitting information. These are not exclusive uses of course: a thank you letter is not usually sent with the purpose of transmitting information unknown to the recipient.

The written word has allowed humans to communicate with people they have never met, and it is particularly well suited to the transmission of information. Writers frequently have little probability of obtaining social benefits from readers. 

## Dissociating informational and social components

The informational and social components of communication are simultaneously present, to a greater or lesser degree, in all communications. They frequently work together, although they can at times work against one another. 

### Synergy

Trusting others involves being vulnerable to them, and this applies as much in the informational context as in the social context. People we can trust can harm us by leading us to believe wrong things (e.g. that global warming is a conspiracy) or by hurting our feelings. The degree to which we have built up a close social relationship with someone enhances the degree to which we tend to trust information they provide, while coordinating activity and sharing information help build those close social bonds.

### Conflict

There are notable conflicts between rational information processing and social communication, however. Social bonds, built primarily on homophily (similarity across a wide array of domains including proximity, social attitudes, behaviours, etc), also tend to reflect redundancy in the sources of information: if everyone in your family knows something, the chances are the knowledge came from the same source. When we are rationally combining information it is important that sources of information are independent, and social closeness tends to work against this. 

### Separation

Regarding my research, the key question to ask is whether the social and informational components of communication are robustly linked, or whether they can be disentangled from one another. Can we get people to rate a less likeable advisor as more trustworthy? We can probably all think of examples from our own lives where people who are very dear to us are routinely ignored when they put forward information, so it is plausible that this is true. It also seems established that people don't account for shared error in advice-taking. A follow-up question is whether we can do this without providing feedback to people. 

People nevertheless invest in maintaining social bonds with people who give them poor information: perhaps maintaining social bonds is fairly well hardwired, making it difficult to shrug off on an individual level; or maybe those who give us poor information offer other forms of support, e.g. emotional or practical assistance.

## Notes:

[^1]: I use _communication_ as distinct from _signaling_. Signaling is involuntary (e.g. microexpressions, gasps), while communication is voluntary (e.g. full expressions, normal speech). 

[^2]: Pinker and Bloom engage with the inverse of this criticism of language (that it is too complicated for the hunter coordination task) with a similar explanation of its social uses (and consequent arms race).
