    * what Ethics is all about
    * intellectual honesty
    * bad arguments for good outcomes (motivated reasoning)
    * Hume, facts vs values
        * Climate change - agree on a problem, disagree on solutions vs deny a problem

* Open science overview

* Are people Bayesian
    * Enlightenment: man as the rational animal, now behavioural economics and Irrationality
    * Perceptual psychology (and other Bayes) vs cognitive biases, social psych
        * Behavioural economic concept of value as an example of a bridge?
        * Reward learning as bridge, e.g. valence biases in RL

* Philosophy of science
    * Can we really know stuff? 
        * Randomness looking like patterns
        * Fallacy of induction
        * Constraints on the kinds of thoughts we can think 
            * Biological
            * Sociocultural
        * Might science just be something that's fulfilling for scientists, with no greater purpose than art for artists?
    * None of the above arguments suggest anything is *more likely* to generate true insights than science, and technology makes a pretty good counterargument. 
        * Have we ever produced a psychological technology (behavioural economics yes, maybe some of our therapies, perhaps brainwashing)
